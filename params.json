{"name":"Provisioning Profiles","tagline":"A tool for listing and organizing your provisioning profiles from your MobileDevice folder.","body":"Provisioning Profiles.app\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThis application lists all profiles of your provisioning folder located at ```~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles```. It shows the profiles contents and allows you to sort and organize them or to move profiles to the trash folder. For parsing the provisioning profiles this application uses the ```security``` command line utility.\r\n\r\n![Provisioning Profiles Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmittendorf/ProvisioningProfiles/master/Screenshot1.jpg \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on provisioning files in the article from  [Craig Hockenberry](http://furbo.org/2013/11/02/a-quick-look-plug-in-for-provisioning/) on his QuickLook plugin or in Sean Heber's [provisioning overview](http://bigzaphod.tumblr.com/post/78574849549/provisioning).\r\n\r\nVersions\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- 1.0.0 (24 May 2015)\r\n  I cleaned up the project and added as a new feature support for QuickLook. Make sure that you have a plugin supporting Provisioning Profiles installed on your computer, like i.e. [the QuickLook plugin from Craig Hockenberry](https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
