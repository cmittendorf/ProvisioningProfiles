Provisioning Profiles.app
=========================

This application lists all profiles of your provisioning folder located at ```~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles```. It shows the profiles contents and allows you to sort and organize them or to move profiles to the trash folder. For parsing the provisioning profiles this application uses the ```security``` command line utility.

You can find more information on provisioning files in the article from  [Craig Hockenberry](http://furbo.org/2013/11/02/a-quick-look-plug-in-for-provisioning/) on his QuickLook plugin or in Sean Heber's [provisioning overview](http://bigzaphod.tumblr.com/post/78574849549/provisioning).

Versions
--------

- 1.0.0 (24 May 2015)
  I cleaned up the project and added as a new feature support for QuickLook. Make sure that you have a plugin supporting Provisioning Profiles installed on your computer, like i.e. [the QuickLook plugin from Craig Hockenberry](https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning).
